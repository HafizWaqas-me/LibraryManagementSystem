# üìö Library Management System

Welcome to the **Library Management System**! This project provides a comprehensive solution for managing a library, offering both a **user-friendly interface** for patrons and **administrative tools** for library staff. Users can browse and view books, manage their profiles, and access issued books, while admins can perform tasks like adding books, issuing and returning books, and managing fines for overdue items. This project also integrates **OneSignal** for notifications to keep users updated on new books, due dates, and other important events.

## üîî Notifications

This Library Management System leverages **OneSignal** for real-time notifications to keep users updated on key events. Notifications are customized based on user roles and relevance.

### Notification Features
- **New Book Notifications**: All users receive notifications whenever a new book is added to the library.
- **Issued Book Notifications**: Only the specific user who has a book issued to them will receive the notification for that transaction, ensuring relevance.
- **Custom Notification System**: This feature allows for targeted notifications, reducing unnecessary alerts for unrelated users.
  
### Technical Implementation
- **OneSignal REST API & OkHttp3 SDK**: The project uses OneSignal's REST API to send notifications. With OkHttp3 SDK, notifications are triggered and sent through the OneSignal server, utilizing REST API keys for secure and efficient message delivery.
